A hodgepodge of code I've carried along over the years.  Mostly quick,
throw away examples to verify I know how some library function or
toolkit feature works.

Warning:  some of the code is 15+ years old and may not conform to
today's standards, style or language.  This is not a repo I keep up
to date.  However, if I revisit an issue, I may update the example --
look at the version timestamps.

Some examples are promoted to templates and placed in my templates
repository.  If it smells like a template, check in the templates repo
for a more current version.
