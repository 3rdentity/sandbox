# Maven / Spring Web Application Demo

This project is the *template* for a demonstration that shows how to:

1. Create a Servlet (webapp) project with Maven's archetype:generate
2. Import that project into Eclipse (w/ m2e)
3. Add dependencies, including spring-webmvc
4. Plumb the web.xml to Spring's DispacherServlet named 'example'
5. Create a set of Spring bean definitions for example-servlet
6. Add a Spring MVC @Controller that returns a simple view (Hello View)

The above can all be accomplished by hand, this maven project is simply 
the result of the exercise and can be used as a basis to cut/paste sections
of code that would be otherwise timely to re-type by hand.
