The objective of this exercise is to create a Python/omniORB based servant that sits
on a fixed, and predetermined port.  Then, the will be given the corbaname for that
IOR and contact the servant.  The goal is to specifically circumvent using the 
Name Service, but to provide a service that is reachable at a well known (IOR) address.

The follow on is to use this method to create an SSL only environment.
