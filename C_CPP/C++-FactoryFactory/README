This pattern is an example of how to create a hierarchy of classes,
each with a factory method that returns a pointer to a constructed
object.  Each class will register via a string name it's factory
constructor before main is invoked.  Thus a user of the FactoryFactory
can simply ask for a new object by name at runtime.
